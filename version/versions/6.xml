<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><notice><author>Philipp Grozinger</author><title>Formulate v0.2.2-alpha</title><text>This update brings the ability to search for and open articles as well as the ability to delete articles. The search function searches through the names of the articles. The entire list of articles can be viewed by pressing the All button or by typing * into the search bar. There are also options to view all articles by the current user and to view the most recent articles. The existing framework has been updated to include categories for individual entries. These categories cannot be managed through Formulate yet, and are simply placeholders.</text><dtime>Fri, 06 Dec 13 17:59:57 +1030</dtime><time>1386314997</time><nin>6</nin><comments>0</comments></notice>
