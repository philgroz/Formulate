<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><notice><author>Philipp Grozinger</author><title>Formulate v0.2.4-alpha</title><text>This update features a lot of bug fixes and tidy-ups in both the code and the interface. Improvements were made across the board, with confirm boxes added for delete functions and the addition of a link to the category management page on the home page. This update fixes many PHP issues with session tokens and tidies up many conditional operators. The editor will now resize to fit the content in the text area. Behind the scenes, a lot of preparation has been made for the activity feed. All major actions are now being logged.</text><dtime>Tue, 10 Dec 13 21:22:18 +1030</dtime><time>1386672738</time><nin>8</nin><comments>0</comments></notice>
