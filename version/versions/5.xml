<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><notice><author>Philipp Grozinger</author><title>Formulate v.0.2.1-alpha</title><text>This update is a huge leap. The editor now has create new, save and edit functions which all use an SQL database to save the data in. It saves and updates files with elegance, making clear database queries with properly encoded text and even a small feature which stops the user from putting in XML tags in the wrong places. The status of a save request can be viewed on the control bar in the editor. This update provides the basic features of the editor and essentially, makes the main functionality of the entire CMS (Content Management System) ready to use.</text><dtime>Sun, 27 Oct 13 23:47:36 +1030</dtime><time>1382879856</time><nin>5</nin><comments>0</comments></notice>
